# SingleNeuronModel
Implementation of single spiking neuron models, variations of lif models and their behaviors analysis

In this report, we tried to implement the first single spiking neuron model **(LIF model)** and
its few variations and analyse its behavior on different input currents and its parameters.

# Table of content
The things we covered in this project are as following : 

1. LIF, Exponential LIF, Adaptive Exponential LIF implementation
2. Variations of input current and model behavior analysis
3. I-F curves and model performance measures
4. Refractory Period Implementation
5. In-depth analysis of the behavior of neurons on different parameters

Both **project report** and **notebook** of the project is available in this repository.
